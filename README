example usage:
   ./assembler.py --in examples/example6.v --out prog
   ./vcpu -r prog  #runs the program


   with the slower examples you probably want to turn off the cycle limit:
   ./vcpu -i -r prog  


   there are couple of knobs you can tweak, 
   and there are tons of untested instructions, and probably undiscovered bugs!
    
   out of the instructions listed in cpu.c

   the following haven't been implemented:
   stx,ldx, in, out
